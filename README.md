# dot-rs: tool for managing dotfiles

I use this to keep my machine up to date. It does a few different things:

## Link

`dot link ~/code/dotfiles ~` symlinks the files in `dotfiles` into the
matching directory in `~` (so `~/.config/git/config` becomes a link to
`~/code/dotfiles/.config/git/config`).

## Update

Coming soon.

Updates all the software on your machine.
